# Switch-Arduino-Joystick
An attempt to make an HID-compatible arduino work as a joystick for the Nintendo Switch

**I started this project a long time ago but never completed it, mainly due to lack of time. However, someone seems to have continued and figured out how to get it working. I haven't tried it myself but check out [celclow/SwitchControlLibrary](https://github.com/celclow/SwitchControlLibrary).**
